[Portkey](https://portkey.ai/) enables you to build and ship generative AI applications, products and features with confidence. Portkey wants to make it easy to work with Large Models that expose an API by offering a hosted middleware to

- View all your prompts & generations in real-time on a beautiful dashboard for logs and metrics
- Manage prompt templates, parameters and engines (together called models) & access them via your private model APIs
- Version your models and deploy as needed

[Portkey is Open Source](https://github.com/Portkey-AI). Host yourself or let us take care of the hosting (charges apply).
